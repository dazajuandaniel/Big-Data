# Big-Data
Big Data Code Repository

This repository contains all my code for working with Big Data. It has (or will have) all of the code where I have had to use NoSQL databases, MapReduce views, Spark code or any other requirement. It is still a Work In Progress.

Each folder has a specific project that I am currently doing.
